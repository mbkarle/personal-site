Though reasonable in scope as a static site, there were plenty of challenges to overcome between rich interactions, responsive design, and integrating with a CMS to alleviate the technical burden of future updates.

Most of what Iâ€™ve done so far has tended to be more theoretical (which is fine by me, I like a mix!), but once in a while things get a bit more applied.
