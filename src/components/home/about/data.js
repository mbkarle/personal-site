My love for software didn't necessarily begin on day one; growing up, I was dead set on being a novelist. I also listened exclusively to prog rock and ate a plant-based diet - some might argue I peaked back then. But around the turn of high school, I realized I could apply those same creative energies to programming, which had an added allure as a novel challenge of critical thought and problem solving. And so my first program came into being, a mess of JavaScript ifs and elses that you had to paste directly into a browser's console. The result was a riveting text-based, dungeon-crawling adventure, presented entirely by primitive \`alert\` and \`prompt\` calls.

Whilst fending off pleas from game publishers to take \`dragon_game.js\` public, I've had some incredible opportunities to develop my skills and grow as a software engineer. Working full time with a brilliant team at Monthly over a 2020 gap year, I gained a new respect and passion for the profession. Their mentorship raised my standards and strengthened my convictions, and the nonstop iteration and shipping of features helped my own performance catch up.

The predominant feeling at this point in my career is that there's loads left to learn. But much as it did when the problems looked like dragons and goblins, it's the challenge that excites me. I suspect the feeling of the uphill climb will never go away, and frankly, I hope that it doesn't.

export const ABOUT_ME = `
I'm an undergraduate at Harvard studying computer science and math. My academic interests have largely tended towards theory and rigorous treatments of topics such as computation and algorithms, but I came to the field via a lasting love for getting hands on and building product.

At the time an aspiring middle school novelist, 13-year-old me first dabbled in programming out of intrigue for the challenge of it all - the complex way so many threads would have to be pulled together coherently to solve a problem. Now, years later, it's still that sense of room for growth that excites and inspires me.

Every project and work experience I've engaged with has proven to be such an opportunity to learn, and conversely shown that the software profession - whether through its mentors, role models, or the projects themselves - is entirely ready and able to teach. I can't wait to make the most of it.
