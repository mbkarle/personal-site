# Matt's Personal Site

A Netlify-deployed static Gatsby site to bring the internet its best addition yet...me?

For now, the site is only "marketing pages"; that is, a developer portfolio and vaguely professional "About Me" copy. In the future, I hope to expand the site to include fun personal content via which I can yell into the void, while being confident no one is wasting their time and looking :)
